             * that xen also incorrectly leaked OSXSAVE into the guest.
             *
             * Furthermore, providing architectural OSXSAVE behaviour to a
             * many Linux PV guests triggered a further kernel bug when the
             * fpu code observes that XSAVEOPT is available, assumes that
             * xsave state had been set up for the task, and follows a wild
             * pointer.
             *
             * Older Linux PVOPS kernels however do require architectural
             * behaviour.  They observe xen's leaked OSXSAVE and assume they
             * can already use XSETBV, dying with a #UD because the shadowed
             * CR4.OSXSAVE is clear.  This behaviour has been adjusted in all
             * observed cases via stable backports of the above changeset.
             *
             * Therefore, the leaking of xen's OSXSAVE setting has become a
             * defacto part of the PV ABI and can't reasonably be corrected.
             * It can however be restricted to only the enlightened CPUID
             * view, as seen by the guest kernel.
             *
             * The following situations and logic now applies:
             *
             * - Hardware without CPUID faulting support and native CPUID:
             *    There is nothing xen can do here.  The hosts XSAVE flag will
             *    leak through and xen's OSXSAVE choice will leak through.
             *
             *    In the case that the guest kernel has not set up OSXSAVE, only
             *    SSE will be set in xcr0, and guest userspace can't do too much
             *    damage itself.
             *
             * - Enlightened CPUID or CPUID faulting available:
             *    xen can fully control what is seen here.  When the guest has
             *    been configured to have XSAVE available, guest kernels need
             *    to see the leaked OSXSAVE via the enlightened path, but
             *    guest userspace and the native is given architectural
             *    behaviour.
             *
