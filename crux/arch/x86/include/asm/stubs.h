/*
 * xen has several per-cpu executable stubs which are written dynamically.
 * These are:
 *
 * - The SYSCALL entry stubs, LSTAR and CSTAR.  These are written on boot, and
 *   are responsible for moving back onto xen's stack.
 *
 * - The emulation stub.  This is used to replay an instruction or sequence
 *   which trapped for emulation.
 *
 * The stubs have an executable alias in l2_xenmap[] (i.e. within 1G of the
 * rest of .text), and are written via map_domain_page().
