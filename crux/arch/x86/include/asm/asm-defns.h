     * clearing bit 47 (i.e. the address was either non-canonical or within xen
     * range), setting the bit will yield a guaranteed non-canonical address.
     * If we didn't clear a bit, we also won't set one: The address was in the
     * low half of address space in that case with bit 47 already clear.  The
