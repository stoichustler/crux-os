/*
 * Linker file fragment to help format the IDT correctly
 *
 * The IDT, having grown compatibly since the 16 bit days, has the entrypoint
 * address field split into 3.  x86 ELF lacks the @lo/@hi/etc relocation forms
 * commonly found in other architectures for accessing a part of a resolved
 * symbol address.
 *
 * However, the linker can perform the necessary calculations and provide them
 * under new symbol names.  We use this to generate the low and next 16 bits
 * of the address for each handler.
 *
 * The upper 32 bits are always a constant as xen's .text/data/rodata sits in
 * a single aligned 1G range, so do not need calculating in this manner.
