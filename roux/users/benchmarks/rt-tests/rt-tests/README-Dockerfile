# README-Dockerfile-rt-tests

## Introduction
This README provides detailed instructions for setting up an rt-tests container using Docker or Podman. This Dockerfile will pull a current copy of your code (plus all of your changes) and compile it into a container image for you to test with. This will give you an imbiguous way to test your changes, assuming you are running on a semi-modern host OS. The rt-tests container can be used to test any of the subpackages found under the rt-tests project, but is mainly intended for hwlatdetect and cyclictest.

## Prerequisites
- Docker or Podman installed on your system.

## Installation
### Prepare Your Environment
- For EPEL systems (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL):
  - Install Podman: `sudo dnf install podman -y`
- For Debian-based systems (Ubuntu):
  - Install Docker: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker.io -y`
  - Alternatively, install Podman: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install podman -y`

### Build the Container
- Navigate to the root directory of the 'rteval'
- Build the container image named 'rteval-upstream':
  - For Podman: `sudo podman build -t rt-tests-upstream .`
  - For Docker: `sudo docker build -t rt-tests-upstream .`

## Usage
### Run the Container
- Start the container in privileged mode:
  - For Podman: `sudo podman run -it --privileged rt-tests-upstream`
  - For Docker: `sudo docker run -it --privileged rt-tests-upstream`
- This will create a long lasting container. In order to use it again (say after a reboot), you need to start and exec into the container to get yourself back into the shell:
  - For Podman: 
    - `sudo podman start rt-tests-upstream`
    - `sudo podman exec -it rt-tests-upstream /bin/bash`
  - For Docker: 
    - `sudo docker start rt-tests-upstream`
    - `sudo docker exec -it rt-tests-upstream /bin/bash`
- And to clean up and remove your container so you can test a new one:
  - For Podman: `sudo podman rm -f rt-tests-upstream`
  - For Docker: `sudo docker rm -f rt-tests-upstream`
- Please note that the above command does not cleanup the container when you are done. It can be useful to run a single use container when trying to only test a quick change and remove the container afterwards. To run a a single use container that removes itself immediately after you exit the shell, run the following commands with the `--rm` option:
  - For Podman: `sudo podman run -it --rm --privileged rt-tests-upstream`
  - For Docker: `sudo docker run -it --rm --privileged rt-tests-upstream`  

### Test rteval Build
- Inside the container, test one of the rt-tests packages you just built: 
  - Command: `cyclictest -D 1s`
  - Command: `hwlatdetect --duration 1`

## Conclusion
Follow these detailed steps for a successful rt-tests container setup using Docker or Podman.
